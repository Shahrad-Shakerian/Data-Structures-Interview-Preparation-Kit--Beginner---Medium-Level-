# Data Structures Interview Preparation Kit (Beginner - Medium Level)
 This repository covers the basics of data structures and includes interview questions and answers about the data structures. It is essential for entree level machine learning engineers and software engineers. 

# What is data structure and its types?
- Data structure is a way of storing and organizing the data in a way that it can be efficiently accessed. Different types of data structures are arrays, linked lists, stack, and queue.

# What are the different classes of data structure?
1. Linear data structure: 
 - Sequential arrangement.
 - All data can be traversed in single run.
 - E.g., Array, stack, queue

2. Non-linear data structure:
 - Every item is attached to other items.
 - Can't be traversed in one run.
 - E.g., trees, and graphs

# What is Stack?
1. Stack is a linear data structure working with LIFO (last-in-first-out) mechanism.
2. Insertion of item in stack is called PUSH operation.
3. Removal of an item from stack is called POP operation.

# What is a linked list and its advantages?
1. Linked list is a sequence of nodes that each node is connected to the following node.
2. Each node contains data field and reference to the next node; elements are linked using pointers.
3. Linked list has a dynamic data structure, so it can grow or shrink with the data size. Therefore, no need to specify initial size and no memory westage.

# Singly linked list vs. Doubly linked list:
1. In the singly linked list, nodes with a data field and a pointer to nede. However, in the doubly linked list, nodes with a data field and a pointer to previous and next node.
2. In the singly linked list, traversal is allowed in one way. However, in doubly linked list, the traversal is possible in both direction of forward and backward.

# What is queue?
1. Queue is an ordered collection of items.
2. Addition at REAR end, removal at FRONT end.
3. Queue has FIFO stucture, first in first out structure. (elements that is added first will be removed first)

# Stack vs. Queue:
1. In Stack, the insertaion and deletion occur at same end (LIFO). However, in queue, the insertion and deletion occur at opposite ends (FIFO).

# What are binary trees?
1. Tree type data structure with two nodes.
2. Topmost node is called 'Root' and each pointer to left child and right child.
3. Binary trees are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps.
4. Offer advantage of both an ordered array and linked list.

# What is linear search?
1. Each element is checked and compared with the target.
2. The process is repeated until the element is found or the file ends.
3. It is time consuming and the time search increases as the data increases.

# What is binary search?
1. Works only on sorted lists or arrays.
2. Target value is compared with the middle most item. If target value is less than middle value, it continues the same procedure in sub-array left to middle.
3. Search continues until the value is found or sub-array value becomes zero.
4. Quick and efficient method.

# What is recursive algorithm?
1. Routine calls itself from within its own code based on terminating condition.
2. Way of solving a problem by dividing it into sub-problems.
3. Output of one recursion becomes input to the next.

# What is bubble sort?
1. Simplest sorting algorithm.
2. Each pair of adjacent values is compared and positions swapped if order is wrong.
3. Process continues until no swaps required.

# What is merge sort?
1. Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the strategy of divide, conquer, and combine.
2. List is divided recursively into two halves until no division is possible.
3. Merges the smaller list into new list in sorted order.
